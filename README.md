# Subtitles
You can find all of Astral's subtitle scripts and patches, in their various states of completion, stored here.

These files are free for use by anyone, but I request that you appropriately credit Astral (and/or the sources used) when using them for a project aimed at the public domain. Your compliance with this request is greatly appreciated.

Most if not all of these files will be aimed towards BD releases from Moozzi2 due to the request of the community that lacks them. The subtitle scripts should work on other releases, however they will not be supported from me.

## How to use the patch (xdelta) files (for Moozzi2 encodes only)

1. Download the Patch (.rar) file and extract it to the same directory as your Moozzi2 MKVs.
2. Run **3.Apply Patch-Windows.bat** OR **3.Apply Patch-Linux.sh**
3. Once finished, your fully muxed files will be ready in the same directory! (You'll find the original files in a folder called 'old')

You can delete the patch files afterwards if you want.

## How to use the attachment files (for non-Moozzi2 encodes)

1. Download the attachments (.rar) file and extract it somewhere for future reference.
2. Open **MKVToolNix** ([Download it here](https://www.fosshub.com/MKVToolNix.html)) and add your MKV file.
3. Add the **.ass** and **.xml** (if applicable) files from the extracted 'Attachments' folder, under the correct episode folder.
4. Go to the 'Attachments' tab in MKVToolnix and drag the **.otf** and **.ttf** files from the same folder as previous.
5. Select a destination for the fully muxed file at the bottom of MKVToolNix and then click 'Start multiplexing'

Repeat the above steps for each episode as needed.
